# VNINDEX-Stock-Forecasting

## Overview
The VNINDEX Stock Forecasting project aims to predict future VNINDEX stock prices for the upcoming 'n' days (where 'n' is determined by the user). This predictive model employs advanced neural network architectures such as Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to analyze historical stock data and generate accurate forecasts. Model performance is evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric to quantify prediction accuracy.
## Features
- Predictive Analysis: Utilizes neural network architectures to forecast VNINDEX stock prices.
- User-Defined Forecasting: Allows users to specify the number of days for future price predictions.
- Evaluation Metrics: Measures forecast accuracy using the RMSE metric.
## Technologies Used
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for data exploration and model development.
- TensorFlow: Deep learning framework for implementing neural network architectures.
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library for handling stock data.
## Achievements
- MLP Model: Achieved an RMSE of 201.04, providing a baseline for forecasting accuracy.
- RNN Model: Attained an RMSE of 22.64, demonstrating enhanced forecasting accuracy compared to the MLP model.
- LSTM Model: Obtained an RMSE of 30.05, showcasing the model's proficiency in capturing long-term dependencies within the data.
## Getting Started
To get started with the VNINDEX Stock Forecasting project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VNINDEX-Stock-Forecasting.git
```
2. Install the required dependencies:
